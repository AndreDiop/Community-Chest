# About
Community fridges offer free food to those who need it— from fresh produce to home-cooked meals — along with sanitary products and other health-related supplies to communities in need, no questions asked. While they’ve been around for years, community fridges have recently gotten more attention as a way for people to support each other in pandemic times. With our application Community Chest, it makes the maintaining and operation of a community fridge easier by;
	- Allowing users to add their location to connect them to a network of community fridges.
	- Access controlled inventory management allowing  items to  be created, updated and deleted.  
	- Access controlled location management allowing users to  fully manage the creation and editing of new locations.
	- Allows users of the community to view items in a location before making the trip to the community fridge.
	- Resources available to users to allow them the information to implement community fridges ihn their own neighborhoods.
